Just like standard output, you can also redirect the error channel of commands.
Here, we'll learn about *File Descriptor numbers*.
A File Descriptor (FD) is a number that *describes* a communication channel in Linux.
You've already been using them, even though you didn't realize it.
We're already familiar with three:

- FD 0: Standard Input
- FD 1: Standard Output
- FD 2: Standard Error

When you redirect process communication, you do it by FD number, though some FD numbers are implicit.
For example, a `>` without a number implies `1>`, which redirects FD 1 (Standard Output).
Thus, the following two commands are equivalent:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ echo hi > asdf
hacker@dojo:~$ echo hi 1> asdf
```

Redirecting errors is pretty easy from this point.
If you have a command that might produce data via standard error (such as `/challenge/run`), you can do:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ /challenge/run 2> errors.log
```

That will redirect standard error (FD 2) to the `errors.log` file.
Furthermore, you can redirect multiple file descriptors at the same time!
For example:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ some_command > output.log 2> errors.log
```

That command will redirect output to `output.log` and errors to `errors.log`.

Let's put this into practice!
In this challenge, you will need to redirect the output of `/challenge/run`, like before, to `myflag`, and the "errors" (in our case, the instructions) to `instructions`.
You'll notice that nothing will be printed to the terminal, because you have redirected everything!
You can find the instructions/feedback in `instructions` and the flag in `myflag` when you successfully pull this off!
